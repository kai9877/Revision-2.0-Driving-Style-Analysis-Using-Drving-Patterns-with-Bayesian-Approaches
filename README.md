# Version 2.0 Revision 'Driving Style Analysis Using Primitive Driving Patterns With Bayesian Nonparametric Approaches'

The program starts around the beginning of Chinese new year in 2022, which is around February. The first edition was finished in 2021.6.

Problem fixed:

1. Data was not so much in Version 1.0.
2. Add explainations in codes to have better understanding.
3. Mysql codes are updated.
4. Codes quality in windows and linux is guranteed.

   Unix likes system can not work for 100%. Mainly questions are about library 'pyhsmm'. Please check [the documentation](https://github.com/mattjj/pyhsmm)

## Easy Introduction

Anyone even you know nothing about coding can cover and finish this work following my guidence, because I started from scratch to learn and cover the whole thing done by Wang wenshuo(the writtor of paper).

It is believed that you will learn a lot from this work.

1. python 3
   Python is highly welcomed. Recommended downloading way is from its [offical website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

   Recommended way is to download software called **Anaconda**, which can help you manage when you need many python environments to work properly. This situation can offen occurs. [Downloading website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO DOWNLOAD PYTHON ANYMORE.

2. Mysql Server

   It's used to manage data. It's highly efficient to handle data. Many companys are using this software.[Downloading website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

3. Python editor

   Well known python editor are **Pycharm**, **Vscode**, **Geany**, **Spider**, ect. There is no best editor, only editor more suitable.

4. Mysql editor

   There is a Workbech together with mysql server downloaded. It works well.

   But Navicat primium works better. [Downloading website](http://www.navicat.com.cn/products/navicat-premium)
